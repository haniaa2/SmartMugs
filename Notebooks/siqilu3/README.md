- Building the circuit on the breadboard using the ESP32 Dev Board.
- 4/22: Demonstration the functionality of the circuit. Unfortunately the ESP32 Dev Board broke during our process of testing, we purchased the board immediately but shipping may take long. 
- 4/23: Testing and building the heating and sensor subsystem seperately in order to meet some expectation to those subsystems. A new dev board is considered to apply for demonstration.
